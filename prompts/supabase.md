 I would like to create functionality in my database to create a list of people that are available as public speakers each week. Once they have an appointment there should be a certain amount of weeks that the speaker is not available either before or after that date. each  speaker should be able to have a different amount of weeks before or after an appointment that they are not available. The speakers should be taken from the people table And the appointments should be set in the public talks_table. How could I best implement this functionality?
